## What is Human-centered computing (HCC) ?

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

"**Human-centered computing** (**HCC**) studies the design, development, and deployment of mixed-initiative human-computer systems. It is emerged from the convergence of multiple disciplines that are concerned both with understanding human beings and with the design of computational artifacts.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-centered_computing#cite_note-:2-1">[1]</a></sup> Human-centered computing is closely related to [human-computer interaction][1] and [information science][2]. Human-centered computing is usually concerned with systems and practices of technology use while human-computer interaction is more focused on [ergonomics][3] and the [usability][4] of computing artifacts and information science is focused on practices surrounding the collection, manipulation, and use of [information][5].
