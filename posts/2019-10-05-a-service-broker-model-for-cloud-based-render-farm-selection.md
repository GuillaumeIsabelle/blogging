> Cloud computing is gaining popularity in the 3D Animation industry for rendering the 3D images. Rendering is an inevitable task in creating the 3d animated scenes. It is a process where the scene files to be animated is read and converted into 3D photorealistic images automatically. Since it is a computationally intensive task, this process consumes the majority of the time taken for 3D images production. As the scene files could be processed in parallel, clusters of computers called render farms can be use Source: *[[1505.06542] A Service Broker Model for Cloud based Render Farm Selection][1]*
