> NFS, or Network File System, is a distributed file system protocol that allows you to mount remote directories on your server. This lets you manage storage space in a different location and write to that space from multiple clients. NFS provides a relatively quick and easy way to access remote systems over a network and works well in situations where the shared resources must be accessed regularly.
