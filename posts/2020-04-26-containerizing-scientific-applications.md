    <strong>Building up to Vagrant</strong>

    Hashimoto and Dadgar met as freshmen at the University of Washington in 2007 working on the Seattle Project, a research effort to build a global scientific compute cloud. The two worked on containerizing scientific applications to be deployed across millions of computers, with Hashimoto working to automate as much of the platform and device testing as he could.
