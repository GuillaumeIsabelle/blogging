> Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are computational neural network models which are based on the principles of quantum mechanics. The first ideas on quantum neural computation were published independently in 1995 by Subhash Kak[1] and Ron Chrisley,[2] engaging with the theory of quantum mind, which posits that quantum effects play a role in cognitive function. However, typical research in QNNs involves combining classical artificial neural network models (which are widely used in machine learning for the impor Source: *[Quantum neural network - Wikipedia][1]*
