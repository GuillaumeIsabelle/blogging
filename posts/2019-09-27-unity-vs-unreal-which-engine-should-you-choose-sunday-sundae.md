By far the most popular engines for smaller game developers are Unity and Unreal Engine, and for good reason.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Unity vs Unreal is a hotly debated topic, comparable to Microsoft vs Apple.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They are both capable of producing AAA quality graphics, both have great bridges between most of the industry standard softwares.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They come packed with an extensive toolbox including terrain editor, physics simulation, animation, advanced lighting, VR support and much much more.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

There used to be a time when one could easily tell each engine apart simply by looking at a game. Both had their own “look”, for good and bad.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

However that time has passed, and you could not tell one engine apart from the other by just looking at the result. Take the above image as en example, the left character was rendered in Unreal and the right in Unity.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It is more in the hands of the game designers to make a game look a specific way, which is a good thing!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So on the surface, it appears we have a tie? Well.. Not quite.. Each engine has it’s own advantage, and disadvantage. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder as they say, and this is true for game engines as well.

If you are just starting out learning to make games, or perhaps a bit more experienced and are curious whether you made the right decision. Read on as we delve deeper into this ongoing war between two titans Unity vs Unreal.
