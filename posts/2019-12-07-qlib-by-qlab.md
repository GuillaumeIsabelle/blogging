> qLib is a procedural digital asset library for SideFX's Houdini. It is a collection of tools designed to work in accordance with Houdini's native toolset. It improves the production process by allowing you to spend more time on what you want to achieve instead of how to achieve it. Source: *[qLib by qLab][1]*
