> This node uses rainfall, the erodibility of the soil, and entrainment rates as variables to simulate erosion and deposit buildup. This node works iteratively during playback. It will appear to have no effect on the first frame. You need to play the animation to see the effects of the node. Once the simulation converges to something that looks good, you can export the volumes from that frame to a file (using Height Field Output). Source: *[HeightField Erode][1]*
