> We extend parametric texture synthesis to capture rich, spatially varying parametric reflectance models from a single image. Our input is a single head-lit flash image of a mostly flat, mostly stationary (textured) surface, and the output is a tile of SVBRDF parameters that reproduce the appearance of the material. No user intervention is required. Our key insight is to make use of a recent, powerful texture descriptor based on deep convolutional neural network statistics for "softly" comparing the model pr Source: *[Reflectance modeling by neural texture synthesis | ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)][1]* Â  <h1 class="title style-scope ytd-video-primary-info-renderer">
