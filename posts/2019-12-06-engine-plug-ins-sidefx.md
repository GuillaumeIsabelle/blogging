> ENGINE PLUG-INS For Host Applications Houdini Engine brings a procedural node-based approach to some of your favorite apps. In Houdini, build nodes networks that define a recipe that can be applied over and over, then wrap them up to create custom smart assets. Share these assets with colleagues who can load them directly into 3D apps such as Autodesk® Maya,® Autodesk® 3ds Max,® or Cinema 4D® or into game editors such as Unity® or Unreal Engine.® Source: *[Engine Plug-ins | SideFX][1]*
