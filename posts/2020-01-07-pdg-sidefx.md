## PROCEDURAL DEPENDENCY GRAPH

PDG is a procedural architecture designed to distribute tasks and manage dependencies to better scale, automate, and analyze content pipelines for Film, TV, Games, Advertising and VR.

PDG is designed to describe these dependencies visually using nodes that generate sets of actionable tasks then distributes them to multiple cores on the same machine, the compute farm, or even the cloud. PDG provides a rich set of stock nodes to enhance productivity, and manages the dependencies smartly to minimize recompute upon changes.
