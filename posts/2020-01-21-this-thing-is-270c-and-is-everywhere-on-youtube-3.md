Download the PBS Video App: https://ift.tt/2zU8oJZ The universe is microwaving itself. A mystery signal discovered in the 1960s led to a Nobel prize. In this video, Dianna explores one of the most mysterious discoveries in physics - a constant microwave signal that seemed to be coming from everywhere in the universe. It turned out to be light from an unusual process 13.8 billion years ago.
