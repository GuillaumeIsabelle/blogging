> This solver can scale a low-resolution smoke, file, or even liquid simulation into a higher-resolution container. You can add detail with turbulent noise, at a small enough scale to not affect the large-scale motion of the smoke. This lets you set up the general motion of a simulation at a low resolution and then create a higher-resolution version while preserving the original low-resolution network.
