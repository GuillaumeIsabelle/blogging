> This study examines a novel interface design for heavily-featured productivity software. The design includes two interfaces between which the user can easily toggle: (1) an interface personalized by the user containing desired features only, and (2) the default interface with all the standard features. This design was prototyped as a front-end to a commercial word processor and evaluated in a comprehensive field study. The study tested the effects of different interface designs on users' satisfaction and th Source: *[An evaluation of a multiple interface design solution for bloated software | Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems][1]*
