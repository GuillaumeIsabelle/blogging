> This plugin adds a “Tabs” section to the admin panel which allows you to create tabbed content for your website the easy way. You can quickly add your content to your different tabs, choose a color, re-order them at anytime and display them anywhere with a simple shortcode. What you see is what you get, and it’s totally free. Source: *[Responsive Tabs – WordPress plugin | WordPress.org][1]*
