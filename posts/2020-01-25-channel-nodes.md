> Channel node (CHOP) networks A CHOP network contains channel nodes (CHOPs) for manipulating time-based channel data such as animation curves or audio. Houdini creates a default CHOP network at /ch. You can also create your own CHOP networks at any level of the scene (for example, inside a character to control kinematics). Wiring CHOPs together controls the flow of channel data, from nodes that load or fetch the channel data through nodes that modify the channels. You can view the data generated by a CHOP Source: *[Channel nodes][1]*
