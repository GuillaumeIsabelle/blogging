  The Simplest Approach to Subject
  Classification
author: gicomadmin
post_excerpt: 'Museums, galleries, archives, and many libraries – as well as a host of online databases of various types – seek a simpler approach to subject classification. This paper poses the question: “What is the simplest approach to subject classification?” It suggests a synthetic approach which pursues a sentence-like approach to classification. Such an approach not coincidentally has the added advantage of best capturing the nature of a work.'
