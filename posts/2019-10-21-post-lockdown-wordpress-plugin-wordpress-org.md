> Post Lockdown protects your site-critical pages and posts by disabling all non-admin users’ ability to trash or delete them. It can also lock pages and posts, which will disable editing of the post as well as disabling trashing/deleting. Source: *[Post Lockdown – WordPress plugin | WordPress.org][1]*
