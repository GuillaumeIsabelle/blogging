      An environment that does not address in any manner the environment to be encountered by the system, subsystem(s), or component(s) (hardware or software) during its intended operation. Tests in a laboratory environment are solely for the purpose of demonstrating the underlying principles of technical performance (functions), without respect to the impact of environment.

      Not all system(s), subsystem(s), and/or component(s) need to be operated in the operational environment in order to satisfactory address performance margin requirements. Simulated environment can simulate an operational environments, or key aspects thereof, to determine whether an innovation is ready for a test, which is not necessarily final end-user environment. It is an environment that focuses specifically on "stressing" the technology advance in question.
