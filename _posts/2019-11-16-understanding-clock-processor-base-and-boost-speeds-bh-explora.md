These Turbo modes are essentially over-clocks for the masses, but you don’t choose the speed; the system does. When your computer realizes that it needs more clock cycles (say, when you’re trying to render a video), then it will crosscheck the need for speed with its temperature. If it’s cool enough, that means there’s thermal overhead for it to over-clock, at which point it will bring itself up to the boost speed. How long it lasts depends both on how long the system feels it needs to boost, and also whether or not it continues to be reasonably cool. sSource: *[Understanding Clock: Processor Base and Boost Speeds | B&H Explora][1]*
