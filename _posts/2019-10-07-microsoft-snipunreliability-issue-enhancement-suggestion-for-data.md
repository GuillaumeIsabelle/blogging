<!-- wp:paragraph -->

When I captured many clip when creating, I want to save them when I review my sequence of action few minutes later but when Windows explorer crash (which is another issue but a reality that it often does) Snip app do not keep those capture.  
It should give us the opportunity to Specify a folder where these Snip are saved as they are captured with simple datetimestamping.
