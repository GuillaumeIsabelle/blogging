> I thought my collection of SOuP walkthroughs was a nice gentle intro for the average maya artist. Now that I've been using Houdini for a little while, and knowing that SOuP is heavily influenced by Houdini, it seemed like a good idea to try and port those tutorials over.I've become the Houdini evangelist I always despised, and I apologise for nothing. It really is a great piece of software, warts and all, and it's easier to get into than ever. Do it!If you've landed here and you're totally new to Houdini, maybe head to HoudiniGettingStarted first, has a quick overview of how to use this site, and how to get comfy with Houdini as quickly as possible.
