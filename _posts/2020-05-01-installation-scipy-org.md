> Scientific Python Distributions (recommended) Python distributions provide the language itself, along with the most commonly used packages and tools. These downloadable files require little configuration, work on almost all setups, and provide all the commonly used scientific python tools. Anaconda works on Windows, Mac, and Linux, provides over 1,500 Python/R packages, and is used by over 15 million people. Anaconda is best suited to beginning users; it provides a large collection of libraries all in one. Source: *[Installation — SciPy.org][1]*
