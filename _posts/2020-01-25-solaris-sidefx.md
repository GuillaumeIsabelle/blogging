> LOPS Transitioning your Lighting Workflow For Lighting artists, it is easy to bring geometry, lights and cameras into the Solaris LOPS context and set them up for rendering in Karma. Once in LOPS, these elements become USD that can be analyzed in the Scene Graph. You can then configure and export the pieces as USD for use in other shots. Source: *[Solaris | SideFX][1]*
