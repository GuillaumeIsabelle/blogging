> This tutorial demonstrates how to generate images of handwritten digits using a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN). The code is written using the Keras Sequential API with a tf.GradientTape training loop.What are GANs?Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are one of the most interesting ideas in computer science today. Two models are trained simultaneously by an adversarial process. A generator ("the artist") learns to create images that look real, while a discriminator ("the art Source: *[Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network  |  TensorFlow Core][1]*
