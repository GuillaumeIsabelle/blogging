> Hooks Hooks are a way for one piece of code to interact/modify another piece of code. They make up the foundation for how plugins and themes interact with WordPress Core, but theyâ€™re also used extensively by Core itself. There are two types of hooks: Actions and Filters. To use either, you need to write a custom function known as a Callback, and then register it with WordPress hook for a specific Action or Filter.
