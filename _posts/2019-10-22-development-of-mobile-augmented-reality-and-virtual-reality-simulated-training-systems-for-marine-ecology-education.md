  Development of mobile augmented-reality
  and virtual-reality simulated training
  systems for marine ecology education

  The paper is a case study for the
  effectiveness of hand-held and
  head-mounted AR interaction for
  increasing teaching and learning, in the
  specific field of marine ecology
  education. This system will serve as an
  assisting tool for the teaching activity
  of marine ecology guide to improve the
  learning effectiveness of the learners.
  A total of 191 questionnaires were
  collected, there were 161 valid
  questionnaires, among which including 70
  AR questionnaires, 91 AR2VR
  questionnaires. There were 30 incomplete
  invalid questionnaires. This study
  adopts the pre-test and post-test
  variance design of the
  quasi-experimental research method to
  explore the learnersâ€™ flow experience
  effect, technology acceptance model,
  activity involvement and learning effect
  under different guidance modes, as well
  as their attitudes towards the use and
  acceptance of the guidance system. The
  experiments are performed and analyzed
  in detail. The study results indicate
  that (a) the learning achievements of
  the students differed between before and
  after the AR and VR mobile guidance
  activities, (b) both the AR and VR
  guidance modes enhanced the flow
  experience of visitors, (c) all aspects
  of the technology acceptance models in
  both groups had positive effects on the
  flow experience, (d) all aspects of the
  activity involvement of both groups had
  positive effects on flow experience, and
  (e) most learners exhibited positive
  attitudes toward and acceptance of using
  AR and VR mobile guidance systems.
