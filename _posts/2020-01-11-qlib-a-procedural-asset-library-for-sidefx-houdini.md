<!-- wp:paragraph -->

qLib is a **procedural** digital asset library for SideFX's Houdini. It is a collection of tools designed to work in accordance with Houdini's native toolset. It improves the production process by allowing you to spend more time on *what* you want to achieve instead of *how* to achieve it.
