  The principle of variation is a very
  interesting subject to me as we, artist,
  desire system to offer great way (and
  automated) to generates those variations

> The Wedge ROP will render the specified ROP multiple times. Each time it will vary some parameters in the .hip file. This is useful for exploring how changing parameters will change the look for expensive functions. The WEDGE variable will be set to a string that describes the current set of parameters. Using this in filenames output can ensure each wedge doesnâ€™t conflict with the other wedges. Alternatively, if one is wedging to MPlay, the individual wedges will render together. The output file could be set to filename_$WEDGE_$F.pic to ensure each wedge gets its own image sequence Source: *[Wedge][1]*
