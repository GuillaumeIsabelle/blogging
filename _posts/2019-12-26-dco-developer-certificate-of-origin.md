<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) was introduced in 2004[1] by the Linux Foundation, to enhance the submission process for software used in the Linux kernel, shortly after the SCOâ€“Linux disputes.[2]DCOs are often used as an alternative to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Instead a signed legal contract, a DCO is an affirmation that the source code being submitted originated from the developer, or that the developer has permission to submit the code. Proponents of the DCO contend that it reduces the barriers of entry introduced by a CLA.
